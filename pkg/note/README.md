The `note` package folder is designed to provide a robust underlying manager for the wrapping command-line interface (CLI) scripts. This package serves as the core engine that powers the various functionalities of the note CLI tool, ensuring that all operations related to note management are executed efficiently and reliably. By encapsulating the core logic within this package, the design promotes a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to extend.
